# Project Hamilton

[![ProjectHamilton](https://img.youtube.com/vi/RKmJ0yw14xs/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/RKmJ0yw14xs "Demonstration")  

* This is a project that (one day) should make it possible for anyone to make their Python programs accessible through protocols (such as SSH) by using simple calls.
* This project aims to make it easy for all users. There are no needs to edit 'server.py'. You simply just dropping off your projects in the folder `./cmods`.
* See the examples in the folder `./cmods`! Where you would call from the command prompt '-example'.

### Example what you could do with this project:
* Create your own command modules so you can access GPIO headers on your Raspberry Pi.
* Run ProjectHamilton on your Android device to gain more access and improve the creativity of your apps.
* Customize your messages (motd).
* Whatever imagination you have and want to make possible.

### To add/fix:
* ~~Graceful shutdown of the client sockets.~~
* ~~Import your own modules.~~
* ~~Run Startup scripts.~~
* ~~Seperated logs.~~
* Access to each modules.
* Clean up the code for a better understanding.
* Add support for other protocols such as `SSL`, `Bluetooth` and `oscpy`.
