.:HOW TO USE HAMILTON:.

For now ProjectHamilton is currently working only with Paramiko SSH.

Make sure you have a valid ssh keys.
Otherwise you would need to execute `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@domain.com"` on the host.
Check the `config.json`, there might is something else you want to change.

Run server with `python3 server.py` and launch another Terminal or Tab
and connect with `ssh yourusername@localhost -p 2200 terminal`.

Port is set to `2200` instead of `22`. And can be changed in `config.json`.
